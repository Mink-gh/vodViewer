this is a web app that helps store your replays organized.

app gets its data from an google doc file. that has the videos link;
for Valorant, that file should have the replays date, agent and map being played. -----//its not ready for multiple games atm

there is a searchbar, date selector, agent and map selectors. -----//agent and map selectors let you multiselect

after putting your parameters it should show a list either in an excel like format(as drawn at _1),
or as a youtube like video format(as drawn at _2). -----//it's now number one
